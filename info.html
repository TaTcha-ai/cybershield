            <h3><br>Terms that user need to know:</h3><br>
            <p>-Data Compromised often referred to as a data breach, is the unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, or use of sensitive data. This can involve the exposure, theft, or alteration of information that should be kept private or secure. It typically occurs when someone bypasses security measures and gains unauthorized access to a system or network.</p><br>
            <p>-A zero-day exploit is a type of cyberattack that takes advantage of a software vulnerability that is not known to the company that developed it yet, meaning they haven't released a patch for it. Basically, it's an attack that occurs on the very first day that the vulnerability is discovered. The term "zero-day" means that the software or hardware seller has no time to fix the problem before it starts being taken advantage of.</p><br>
            <p>A mitigation method refers to actions taken to reduce the severity, impact, or likelihood of a negative event or condition.</p>
            <p>Outcome is to determine weather the company or individual manage to prevent and stop the cyber attack or not.</p>

                <li>On average, massive amount of data is compromised per incident that highlighting the massive data risk associated with each attack.</li><br>
                <li>It takes about 90 minutes to respond to threats, suggesting room for faster detection and action.</li><br>
                <li>Approximately 100,000 attackers have been identified based on their IP addresses which indicating widespread and persistent threats all over the world.</li><br>

                <p>1. Number of Data Compromised in GB by month:</p><br>
                <p>-This line chart shows a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in data compromises, peaking at 8.6k incidents in one month and dipping to 7.9k in another for all country. The shaded confidence band reflects prediction or uncertainty for future months.</p><br>
                <p>2. Number of Attackers by User Role </p>
                <p>-External entities are the most common threat actors, but Admins, Employees, and Contractors are also significant sources of attacks which pointing to possible insider threats</p><br>
                <p>3. Average Attack Duration by Severity</p>
                <p>Attack duration is not uniform but it fluctuates with severity. On average, high-severity attacks can last up to 157 minutes, while others may be shorter. These insights suggest that more severe attacks require longer detection and mitigation efforts, emphasizing the need for faster threat response systems.</p><br>
